# Visualization_CMI_2022
Hi, I am Aniket, a student of Chennai Mathematical Institute.
This is a project that I did (during the August-December semester of 2022-23 session) as a part of my coursework here at CMI.

### Dashboard Link
The dashboard was made using RShiny. Here is the [link](https://anisaha.shinyapps.io/Visualization/).

### Description
So first of all, I decided to work with FIFA World Cup data as I am a footballâš½ maniac and 2022 World Cup was knocking at the door, which was quite exciting.

Then the next step was to collect the required information from reliable sources. So I headed to the official website of [FIFA](https://www.fifa.com/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) etc. After collecting the information, some preprocessing was needed and then the data was ready for further analysis.

After that I tried to gain some insights from the data by creating a few charts and plotting some graphs.

Then the key part of the project was to predict who was going to win the world cup. Our first choice was **Brazil**, then **France**, **Argentina** and **Spain**.

Also, we tried to predict the average goal per game for the 2022 World Cup. Our prediction was **2.75 goals per game**, and in fact, we observed **2.67 goals per game** at the World Cup.

I used some form of regression models to come up with these two predictions.
